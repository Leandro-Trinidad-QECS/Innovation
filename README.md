## Computing Innovation: Machine Learning
Machine Learning. Machine learning is a subfield of computer science that evolved from the study of pattern recognition and computational learning theory in artificial intelligence. Machine learning explores the construction and study of algorithms that can learn from and make predictions on data. Such algorithms operate by building a model from example inputs in order to make data-driven predictions or decisions, rather than following strictly static program instructions. For instance, the military uses machine learning to classify surveillance images as threats or non-threats. By "training" the software through providing 100s of thousands of images of threats (e.g. enemy tanks) and 100s of thousands of images of non-threats (e.g. friendly tanks), the software learns the characteristics of threat and non-threat images and then when presented a new image, can classify it as threat or non-threat. Machine learning can be applied to do classification in many fields. More information on Machine Learning
